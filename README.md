# Secure Captcha Implementation with Nuxt.js and Server-Side Validation

This project demonstrates a secure captcha implementation using Nuxt.js, focusing on server-side validation to enhance security.

## Techniques Used:

**1. Server-Side Captcha Generation and Storage:**

- The captcha text is generated on the server-side using the `/api/captcha` endpoint (`captcha.get.js`).
- Instead of relying solely on client-side cookies, which can be vulnerable, we use HTTP-only cookies with a short expiration time (2 minutes) to store the generated captcha.
- For increased security, consider implementing server-side sessions or database storage to manage the captcha token, as explained in the "Enhanced Security Considerations" section.

**2. Client-Side Display and Input:**

- The client-side component (`serverCaptcha.vue`) fetches the captcha text from the server on mount.
- The captcha is displayed with visual noise (random characters) to make it harder for bots to read.
- The user inputs their guess in a text field.

**3. Server-Side Captcha Validation:**

- The client submits the form data, including the user's captcha input, to the `/api/validate` endpoint (`validate.post.js`).
- The server reads the captcha value from the HTTP-only cookie.
- The server validates the user's input against the stored captcha value:
   - If the values match (case-insensitive in this example), the captcha is considered valid.
   - If the values don't match or the cookie is expired, the captcha validation fails.

**4. Feedback to the User:**

- The server sends back a JSON response indicating success or failure.
- The client-side component displays an appropriate message to the user based on the validation result.

## Files:

- **`serverCaptcha.vue`:** The main Vue component handling captcha display, user input, and communication with the server.
- **`captcha.get.js`:** The server-side endpoint for generating the captcha text and setting the HTTP-only cookie.
- **`validate.post.js`:** The server-side endpoint for validating the user's captcha input against the stored value.

## Enhanced Security Considerations:

- **Server-Side Sessions:** Store the captcha value in a server-side session instead of a cookie. This prevents the captcha value from ever being sent to the client.
- **Database Storage:** For even stronger security, store captcha values in a database, leveraging a secure session management library.

## How to Run:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Note:

- This is a basic implementation for demonstration purposes. Further security enhancements might be needed based on specific application requirements.
- Consider adding rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Always use a strong, unique secret key for session management and store it securely in an environment variable.
